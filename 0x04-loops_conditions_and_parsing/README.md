# 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing

## A project on:
- How to create SSH keys
- The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
- How to use while, until and for loops
- How to use if, else, elif and case condition statements
- What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them

## Requirements
- All  files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Bash script must pass Shellcheck

## Challenges
- **[0-RSA_public_key.pub](0-RSA_public_key.pub)**: Generates a public SSH key
- **[1-for_holberton_school](1-for_holberton_school)**: Uses the `for` loop to display "Holberton School" 10 times
- **[2-while_holberton_school](2-while_holberton_school)**: Uses the `while` loop to display "Holberton School" 10 times
- **[3-until_holberton_school](3-until_holberton_school)**: Uses the `until` loop to display "Holberton School" 10 times
- **[4-if_9_say_hi](4-if_9_say_hi)**: Displays Holberton School 10 times, but on 9th iteration, displays "Hi" on a new line
- **[5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance](5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance)**: Script that loops from 1 to 10 and:
	- Displays bad luck f_r the 4th loop iteration
	- Displays good luck for the 8th loop iteration
	- Displays Holberton School for the other iterations
- **[6-superstitious_numbers](6-superstitious_numbers)**: Script that displays numbers from 1 to 20 and:
	- Displays bad luck from China for the 4th loop iteration
	- Displays bad luck from Japan for the 9th loop iteration
	- Displays bad luck from Italy for the 17th loop iteration
- **[7-clock](7-clock)**: Script that displays the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes
- **[8-for_ls](8-for_ls)**: Displays contents of a directory without the file number
- **[9-to_file_or_not_to_file](9-to_file_or_not_to_file)**: Script that gives you information about a file
- **[10-fizzbuzz](10-fizzbuzz)**: Bash FizzBuzz script
